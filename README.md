Introduction:
This project delves into the application of advanced neural network architectures for classification 
tasks in artificial intelligence. You will explore the power of combining (hybrid) or ensembling 
different neural network models to achieve superior results compared to single models. 
Throughout the project, you will utilize a dataset of your choice (text, images, etc.) and implement 
your chosen approach to solve a classification problem.
Objectives:
• Select and explore a real-world dataset suitable for classification.
• Apply and compare the performance of hybrid or ensemble neural network architectures 
for the chosen classification task.
• Evaluate the models using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, F1-score, AUCROC curve, confusion matrix, and heat matrix then visualize the results effectively.
• Gain practical experience in neural network design, training, and evaluation.
The dataset I chose for this project is IMDB movies dataset to anaylse the sentiment behind the reviews.
